== About Me
I am a first-year Ph.D. student in Machine Learning at the [https://www.gatech.edu/ Georgia Institute of Technology] advised by [https://www2.isye.gatech.edu/~tzhao80/ Tuo Zhao] and an ML research intern at [https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/ Microsoft Research] advised by [https://www.neelj.com/ Neel Joshi]. My work is generously supported by the [https://ndseg.sysplus.com/ DoD NDSEG Fellowship].\n\n

I received my B.S. in Applied and Computational Mathematics at the [https://www.usc.edu University of Southern California] advised by [https://viterbi-web.usc.edu/~shaddin/ Shaddin Dughmi], where I was a Trustee Scholar and Viterbi Fellow. My senior thesis in convex optimization won the Discovery Scholar recognition for exemplary research. Previously, I was a machine learning research intern at [https://x.company Google X] and [https://sandia.gov/ Sandia National Laboratories].
