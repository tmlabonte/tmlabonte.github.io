== About Me
I am a research intern in machine learning at [https://x.company Google X] and an undergraduate researcher in the [https://viterbi-web.usc.edu/~cstheory/ Theory Group] at USC, previously advised by [https://jasondlee88.github.io/ Jason D. Lee] and [http://david-kempe.com/ David Kempe]. Previously, I was a research intern in machine learning at [https://sandia.gov Sandia National Laboratories] and the [https://afresearchlab.com Air Force Research Laboratory]. I am a junior at USC pursuing a BS in Applied and Computational Mathematics, with a minor in Computer Science. I will graduate in May 2021, and I plan to attend a PhD program in machine learning theory.\n\n
